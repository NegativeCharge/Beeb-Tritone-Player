# BBC Micro Tritone 1-bit Beeper Engine Player

- Tritone beeper music engine
- Original Z80 code by Shiru 03'2011, released as Public Domain
- 1tracker version by Shiru 03'2018
- 6502 engine port by utz 03'2024

The track currently needs to be included at the bottom of main.6502 (samples are in the tracks directory)

Tritone tracks can be composed in 1Tracker (https://shiru.untergrund.net/software.shtml) - you will need to export the track in Atari ca65 format, and manually convert to BeebAsm format (see samples for changes required).

**NOTE: This is currently in a barely working state and needs a lot of optimization**

Release Notes:

- v0.1 - Initial BeebAsm port
